## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am Shen Fuwen from the 2017 Computer Science and Technology Major of Northwestern University. During my college years, I have been strict with myself in my study. I won the third-class scholarship in both my freshman and sophomore years, ranked the third in my class in the overall ranking in my junior year, and won the first-class scholarship. My GPA is of 3.29 credits, which ranks at 8/89, in the course: program design basis (C) (91), the data structure (94), computer constitute principle (90), object facing programming (C + +) (90), computer graphics (93), the operating system (94), the compilation techniques (91), computer architecture (91), etc., these courses make me have good computer basis, and make me deeply realize the basic qualities that a student majoring in computer science and technology must have. 

I have also taken an active part in various competitions. I have participated in the Mathematical Modeling National Competition for 19 years and the Mathematical Modeling Beauty Competition for 20 years as a programmer, and have won the provincial first prize and Honorable Mention prize. In the competition, through the flexible use of C++, matlab, python and other tools, I learned how to apply programming to solve practical problems, and learned how to learn and quickly apply new knowledge. 

In my daily life, I am good at thinking and applying what I have learned: Because of the need of English learning, I have written word frequency statistics, word frequency statistics, word list combination, word list intersection, etc., all kinds of operation word list and extracting word code. 

In English study, my cet-6 gets 477, and my Duolingo English test score is 110. believe that I have enough English language ability. And plus, I have been studying TOEFL, reciting words and practicing listening to improve my English ability.
